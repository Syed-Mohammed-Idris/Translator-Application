It demonstrates the developed system flow and functionalities. The
flow is discussed outlined below as follows:

 The user connects with the application and inputs the text after
selection of language to be converted into.

 Then the application carries out the pre-processing task of the text
entered.

 As this application requires internet connection to operate, it does the
word comparison process according to the language selected.

 After this process, it matches the input word/sentence based upon the
text unit library of the application.

 Finally, it displays the translated text in form of the selected language
options.
